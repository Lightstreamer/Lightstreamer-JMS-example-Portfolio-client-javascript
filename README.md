# Lightstreamer JMS Gateway - Basic Portfolio Demo - HTML Client #

This project includes a front-end example based on the Basic Portfolio Demo for Lightstreamer JMS gateway.

In the JMS Portfolio Demo, a virtual stock portfolio, shared among all the connected users, is displayed.
By using the "Submit Order" panel, you can buy or sell a stock (identified by an item number), filling in the Quantity field and pressing the proper button.<br>
The portfolio grid is updated in push mode, for both the columns and the rows (this is the so called "metapush" feature).<br>
This page uses the <b>JMS JS Client API for Lightstreamer</b> on top of <b>JavaScript Client API for Lightstreamer</b> to handle the communications with Lightstreamer Server.<br>

# Deploy #

Before you can run the demo of this project some dependencies need to be solved:

-  Get the lightstreamer.js file from the [latest Lightstreamer distribution](http://www.lightstreamer.com/download) and put it in the root folder of this project.
-  Get the require.js file form [requirejs.org](http://requirejs.org/docs/download.html) and put it in the root folder of this project.
-  Get the lightstreamer-jms.js file from the [Lightstreamer JMS Gateway preview](http://www.lightstreamer.com/download) (please click the "From the Labs" section) and put it in the root folder of this project.

Now, you need to configure the index.html of this example by specifying the name of the data adapter you are going to use. By default the demo will look for the <b>HornetQ</b> data adapter, please refer to the related [Service project](https://github.com/Weswit/Lightstreamer-JMS-example-Portfolio-service-java) for more details on the choice of a JMS broker to be used.
To set the data adapter name and the connection name look where the connection is created:

```js
  ConnectionFactory.createConnection(function(conn) {
    ...
    ...
    ...
  }, "http://localhost:8080/", "JMS", "HornetQ", // Change data adapter here
    ...
    ...
    ...
  });
```

To access the demo from a web browser copy it somewhere under your root webserver directory. You can also add it to the standard Lightstreamer demo pages under "LightstreamerHome/pages/demos" directory and access it as: <i>http://_your lightstreamer http address_/demos/PortfolioDemo_JMS/</i>.
